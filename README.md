## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Frontend-focused Full Stack Engineer** who enjoys building **clean, scalable, and high-performance web applications**.  
My strength lies in crafting **great user experiences with React/Next.js**, while being comfortable owning backend APIs, databases, and cloud infrastructure when needed.

I’ve worked on **production SaaS platforms, Web3 products, fintech tools, and internal dashboards**, often owning features end-to-end — from idea to deployment.

I care deeply about:
- Code quality & maintainability  
- Performance and accessibility  
- Real-world impact over vanity features
